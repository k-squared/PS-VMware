PS-VMware
=========

Just another collection of PowerShell functions I've built and partially consolidated from others along the way, to assist in automating common tasks that I perform in VMware ESXi infrastructure.

---
Fuction1: Set-VMHostSNMP - this function will enable and configure the common user-defined variables for SNMP on a VMware ESXi host(s).

---
HELP is available by importing the function and typing 'Get-Help (functionname) -full'
